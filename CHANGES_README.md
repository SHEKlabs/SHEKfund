# Trading Bot Enhancements

This document describes the enhancements made to the trading bot functionality.

## 1. Updated "Executed Trades" Table in Web Interface

### Changes made in `templates/index.html`:

- **Column Rename**: Changed "Value ($)" to "Trade Value ($)" for clarity.
- **New Column**: Added "Fund Value ($)" to display the total value of the fund at the time of the trade.
- **Data Calculation**: The fund value is calculated as the sum of net invested and cumulative profit.
- **UI Improvements**: Updated the trade table to accommodate the new column and handle displaying the data.

## 2. Enhanced Trade Logging Mechanism

### Changes made in `chart_manager.py`:

- **Persistent Storage**: Implemented file-based storage for trade history in JSON format.
- **Data Directory**: Created a `/data/trades` directory to store trade history files.
- **Two File Types**:
  - `all_trades.json`: Stores all trades across all coins
  - `SYMBOL_trades.json`: Stores trades for specific coins (e.g., `BTCUSDT_trades.json`)
- **Loading/Saving Mechanism**: Added methods to load trades on startup and save after each new trade.
- **Preservation Across Restarts**: Ensured that trade history is maintained when the application restarts.
- **New Methods**:
  - `load_trades()`: Loads trade history from files on startup
  - `save_trades()`: Saves trade history to files after each trade
  - `rebuild_trade_arrays()`: Reconstructs buy/sell arrays from trade log
  - `recalculate_pnl()`: Recalculates profit and loss based on trade history
- **Fund Value Field**: Added the fund value field to trade records for the UI.

## 3. Improved OG_buy_sell_threshold_algo

### Changes made in `algo_library.py`:

- **Single Buy Prevention**: Modified the algorithm to prevent multiple buy trades when price is below the buy threshold.
- **New State Tracking**:
  - Added `buy_executed` flag to track if a buy has been executed at the current threshold
  - Added `executed_buy_threshold` to track which threshold the buy was executed at
- **Flag Reset Conditions**:
  - Reset flags when thresholds change
  - Reset flags after a successful sell
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging to show when the duplicate prevention is active

## 4. Updated Trading Bot to Handle Improved Algorithm

### Changes made in `trading_bot.py`:

- **Algorithm Support**: Updated `check_and_execute_trades` to handle the improved OG algorithm.
- **Flag Management**: 
  - Sets `buy_executed` flag after successful buys
  - Resets `buy_executed` flag after successful sells or threshold changes
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Added check to prevent executing duplicate buys in the fallback logic
- **Error Handling**: Improved handling of trade execution errors while maintaining state

## Usage Instructions

### Setting Thresholds:

1. Select a coin and algorithm (OG_buy_sell_threshold_algo)
2. Set buy and sell thresholds
3. Click "Set Thresholds"

The system will now:
- Execute a buy when price falls below the buy threshold (once per threshold)
- Execute a sell when price rises above the sell threshold
- Prevent duplicate buys at the same threshold level
- Record trades persistently with fund value tracking
- Display an enhanced trade history table

### Viewing Trade History:

The trade history is now persistent across application restarts and displays:
- Time of trade
- Type (buy/sell)
- Coin
- Price
- Amount
- Trade Value
- Fund Value (new)
- Profit metrics
- Description

## Known Limitations

- The system will allow a new buy if the threshold is changed, even slightly
- Data persistence relies on file-based storage, which may not be ideal for high-frequency trading
- Fund value is calculated based on the current position and doesn't reflect market value changes of held assets

## Future Improvements

- Consider database storage for trade history in high-volume environments
- Add more sophisticated fund value calculations that include unrealized gains/losses
- Implement transaction logs to recover from unexpected shutdowns
- Add data visualization for fund value history over time
